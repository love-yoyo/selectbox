# selectbox
this is a custom selectbox that can display multiple options

# This is my first publish code to github,
# maybe a little simple, but it's a start 
# I think I can do better in this platform

As you can see, the name of this project is selectbox, so it's an enhancement for original selecbox 
and you can change the style of selectbox as you want to.

HOW TO USE:
You may download this js and put it in your web project and write a JS like "$(id).selectbox()" in 
"$(document).ready(function(){...})" in HTML
